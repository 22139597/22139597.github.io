  <div class="intro-box">
    <p>In this unit, I learned about mobile apps and how they are used in daily life for things like navigation, entertainment, and communication. I explored the features of different apps and how they are designed and built.

I used MIT App Inventor to design, develop, and test my own mobile app. I combined code snippets with ready-made and original assets like buttons and sounds. After finishing my app, I got feedback and reviewed it to find ways to improve it. This unit helped me understand how apps are made and improved my skills in app development.</p>

    During this unit, I explored how mobile apps are used and created. I learned about the key features of mobile apps and used <strong>MIT App Inventor</strong> to design and develop multiple apps, here is three of them:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>An <strong>alphabet learning app</strong> for children</li>
    <li>A <strong>drawing color palette app</strong></li>
    <li>A <strong>xylophone notes app</strong></li>
  </ul>
<p> These were the learning aims for this unit:</p>
<ul>
<li>A understand the characteristics and uses of mobile apps</li>
<li>B design a mobile app</li>
<li>C develop and test a mobile app</li>
<li>D review the finished mobile app.</li>
</ul>
<b>A-</b>
<p>I looked at two different mobile apps and explained what they are meant to do and what features they have. I talked about how each app works, what it does well, and what could be improved. This helped me understand the different types of apps and how they are used.</p>
  <p>
    I tested each app, gathered feedback, and reviewed ways to improve them. This helped me understand the full process of mobile app development.</p>
	<b>B-</b>
	<p>I designed an app to help young children aged 3 to 7 learn the alphabet. The app was made to be bright, fun, and easy to use. It helps children learn the shapes of letters and what they sound like. I made sure the design was simple so that young users could enjoy using it without needing help.</p>
	<b>C-</B>
	<P>I created the app using different screens and made sure it was easy to use and worked as planned. I used some ready-made code and also wrote some of my own to match my design. I tested the app to check that everything worked, found any problems, and fixed them.</p>
	<b>D-</B>
	<p>I looked at my final app and checked that it was good for the age group and did what it was meant to do. I explained how testing and feedback helped me improve the app. I also said why I made some changes from my original plan and how they made the app better.</p>
