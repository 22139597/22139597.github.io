  <div class="intro-box">
<p>In this unit, I learned about how websites are created and the different elements they include, such as text, images, videos, and interactive features. I explored the roles involved in website creation, like web developers and content managers.

I designed, developed, and tested a website based on a brief. After completing it, I gathered feedback and reviewed my work to make improvements. This unit helped me build important skills in website design and development.</p>

<p> These were the learning aims for this unit:</p>
<ul>
<li>A-Understand the uses and features of the websites</li>
<li>B-Design a website</li>
<li>C-Develop and test a website</li>
<li>D-Review the finished website</li>
</ul>
<b>A-</B>
<p>I was asked to look at two different websites and write a report about how they work. I explained what each website is used for and why certain features were added. I also reviewed how the features helped make the websites look better, easier to use, and more accessible for different users.</p>
<b>B-</B>
<p>I created a plan for a website that promotes mobile phones, accessories, and services. The website was aimed at people who are interested in buying phones. I made sure the design was simple, fast to load, easy to use, and had some interactive elements to keep users interested.</p>
<p><b>C-</B>
<P>I built the website based on my design and made sure it worked well. I tested it to see how it performed and made changes based on feedback. I added a small interactive feature using basic client-side code to improve how users interact with the site. I also explained how the website meets the goals I set in my design.</P>
<B>D-</B>
<P>I checked how well the finished website matched the needs of the users and the original purpose. I explained how the feedback, testing, and some challenges helped shape the final version. I gave reasons for the changes I made and compared my final website to the first design to show how it improved.
